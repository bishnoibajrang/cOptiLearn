# 🔧 First-Order Optimization Algorithms in C

An efficient and modular C-based library for implementing first-order optimization techniques widely used in machine learning and numerical optimization. From gradient descent variants like Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), Adam, Adagrad, and RMSProp to training models like linear and logistic regression — this project builds everything from scratch without external libraries.

🧠 Ideal for educational, research, and performance-critical applications that need full control over optimization logic in pure C.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ Scalar and multi-dimensional gradient descent  
- ✅ Adaptive learning algorithms (Adam, Adagrad, RMSProp)  
- ✅ Line search using Armijo rule  
- ✅ Logistic & Linear Regression using all optimizers  
- ✅ Clean modular design using headers and source separation  
- ✅ Easy benchmarking and comparison across optimizers  
- ✅ Works on real datasets (e.g., Iris CSV)
